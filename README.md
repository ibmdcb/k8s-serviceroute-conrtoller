# serviceroute-controller

This controller controls the lifecyle of a CRD called ServiceRoute. In the example below, for a service called **grafana** in the namespace **grafana-blendstat**, the ServiceRoute declares a route called **grafana-route**.
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.dcb/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceRoute
metadata:
  name: grafana
  namespace: grafana-blendstat
spec:
  routeName: grafana-route
```
The controller acts as the route provider. It monitors the CRD and creates the route using potentially any ingress setup or DNS automation, but in the current implementation, it creates routes on a separate Istio cluster using Virtual Service, Destination Rules, and Ingress Gateway. Upon completion, the controller will update the status with FQDN.
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.dcb/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceRoute
metadata:
  name: grafana
  namespace: grafana-blendstat
spec:
  routeName: grafana-route
status:
  fullRouteName: grafana-route.fqdn.com
```
In essense, it allows an istio cluster to provide **route as a service**, a service needed when manual setup of wildcard dns and certificate takes time.

## Details

The sample controller uses [client-go library](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/tree/master/tools/cache) extensively.
The details of interaction points of the sample controller with various mechanisms from this library are
explained [here](docs/controller-client-go.md).

## Fetch sample-controller and its dependencies

Like the rest of Kubernetes, sample-controller has used
[godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) and `$GOPATH` for years and is
now adopting go 1.11 modules.  There are thus two alternative ways to
go about fetching this demo and its dependencies.

### Fetch with godep

When NOT using go 1.11 modules, you can use the following commands.

```sh
go get -d k8s.io/sample-controller
cd $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/sample-controller
godep restore
```

### When using go 1.11 modules

When using go 1.11 modules (`GO111MODULE=on`), issue the following
commands --- starting in whatever working directory you like.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller.git
cd sample-controller
```

Note, however, that if you intend to
[generate code](#changes-to-the-types) then you will also need the
code-generator repo to exist in an old-style location.  One easy way
to do this is to use the command `go mod vendor` to create and
populate the `vendor` directory.

### A Note on kubernetes/kubernetes

If you are developing Kubernetes according to
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/github-workflow.md
then you already have a copy of this demo in
`kubernetes/staging/src/k8s.io/sample-controller` and its dependencies
--- including the code generator --- are in usable locations
(valid for all Go versions).

## Purpose

This is an example of how to build a kube-like controller with a single type.

## Running

**Prerequisite**: Since the sample-controller uses `apps/v1` deployments, the Kubernetes cluster version should be greater than 1.9.

```sh
# assumes you have a working kubeconfig, not required if operating in-cluster
go build -o sample-controller .
./sample-controller -kubeconfig=$HOME/.kube/config

# create a CustomResourceDefinition
kubectl create -f artifacts/examples/crd.yaml

# create a custom resource of type Foo
kubectl create -f artifacts/examples/example-foo.yaml

# check deployments created through the custom resource
kubectl get deployments
```

## Use Cases

CustomResourceDefinitions can be used to implement custom resource types for your Kubernetes cluster.
These act like most other Resources in Kubernetes, and may be `kubectl apply`'d, etc.

Some example use cases:

* Provisioning/Management of external datastores/databases (eg. CloudSQL/RDS instances)
* Higher level abstractions around Kubernetes primitives (eg. a single Resource to define an etcd cluster, backed by a Service and a ReplicationController)

## Defining types

Each instance of your custom resource has an attached Spec, which should be defined via a `struct{}` to provide data format validation.
In practice, this Spec is arbitrary key-value data that specifies the configuration/behavior of your Resource.

For example, if you were implementing a custom resource for a Database, you might provide a DatabaseSpec like the following:

``` go
type DatabaseSpec struct {
	Databases []string `json:"databases"`
	Users     []User   `json:"users"`
	Version   string   `json:"version"`
}

type User struct {
	Name     string `json:"name"`
	Password string `json:"password"`
}
```

## Validation

To validate custom resources, use the [`CustomResourceValidation`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/#validation) feature.

This feature is beta and enabled by default in v1.9.

### Example

The schema in [`crd-validation.yaml`](./artifacts/examples/crd-validation.yaml) applies the following validation on the custom resource:
`spec.replicas` must be an integer and must have a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 10.

In the above steps, use `crd-validation.yaml` to create the CRD:

```sh
# create a CustomResourceDefinition supporting validation
kubectl create -f artifacts/examples/crd-validation.yaml
```

## Subresources

Custom Resources support `/status` and `/scale` subresources as a [beta feature](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#subresources) in v1.11 and is enabled by default.
This feature is [alpha](https://v1-10.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/#subresources) in v1.10 and to enable it you need to set the `CustomResourceSubresources` feature gate on the [kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-apiserver):

```sh
--feature-gates=CustomResourceSubresources=true
```

### Example

The CRD in [`crd-status-subresource.yaml`](./artifacts/examples/crd-status-subresource.yaml) enables the `/status` subresource
for custom resources.
This means that [`UpdateStatus`](./controller.go#L330) can be used by the controller to update only the status part of the custom resource.

To understand why only the status part of the custom resource should be updated, please refer to the [Kubernetes API conventions](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status).

In the above steps, use `crd-status-subresource.yaml` to create the CRD:

```sh
# create a CustomResourceDefinition supporting the status subresource
kubectl create -f artifacts/examples/crd-status-subresource.yaml
```

## Cleanup

You can clean up the created CustomResourceDefinition with:

    kubectl delete crd foos.samplecontroller.k8s.io

## Compatibility

HEAD of this repository will match HEAD of k8s.io/apimachinery and
k8s.io/client-go.

## Where does it come from?

`sample-controller` is synced from
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/sample-controller.
Code changes are made in that location, merged into k8s.io/kubernetes and
later synced here.
